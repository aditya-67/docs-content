## Fixed Deposits integration

### Step 1 — Create an FD app on The Bridge

The Bridge is Setu's developer console for managing your integrations. This is where you will configure your FD app. You can find Setu Fixed Deposits products under the Investments category on The Bridge. Once this config is set up, you will get a secret_key which will be used as an input param during invoking the SDK.
