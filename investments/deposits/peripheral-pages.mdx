## Peripheral pages

These are pages that would be built out by you, which come before or after the fixed deposit booking journey. These help your customers to smoothly complete the fixed deposits journey for your customers within your app or website. While these may not be mandatory, it is recommended that you build this to offer a better product to your users and get a higher conversion rate.

### Create a page to highlight benefits

The Setu Deposits product has many advantages. You may choose to highlight the following details for your customers—

1. **Standalone FD**—No need to open new bank account. A customer can fund their FD from their existing bank accounts using either UPI or net-banking.
2. **Attractive interest rates**—Our bank/NBFC partners give us the best interest rates available in the market, making it lucrative as an investment option.
3. **Insured upto 5 Lakhs**—FD from Banks are insured upto 5 Lakhs by RBI’s wholly owned subsidiary DICGC (Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation).
4. **FDs from multiple banks/NBFC**—Multiple options for FDs on the platform.

### Create a fixed deposit exploration page

If you want to allow your users to explore various FD options that you provide, you can build a page that helps them try out options, even before actually starting the FD booking journey. Examples include FD calculators, interest graphs, comparison between FD providers and so on. Here is one such example—

<Row>
  <Portion desktopSpan="7"/>
  <Portion desktopSpan="10">
  <img
    style={{ margin: "0px" }}
    alt="Sample FD exploration page"
    src="https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-assets/latest/fd_lead_Gen_36297bc433/fd_lead_Gen_36297bc433.png"
  />
  </Portion>

  <Portion desktopSpan="7"/>
</Row>

In order to build an exploration page that is consistent with the current information, we offer these APIs. You can use one or more of them, as per your needs.

1. **FD calculator API—** Get maturity amount corresponding to a particular investment amount, tenure, provider. Implement FD calculator APIs using our <a href="https://docs.setu.co/investments/deposits/api-reference#/category~FD_-_Peripheral_APIs/operation~FDCalculator" target="_blank">API Docs ↗</a>

2. **Misc info API—** Get misc information about all providers. Implement Misc info APIs using our <a href="https://docs.setu.co/investments/deposits/api-reference#/category~FD_-_management_APIs/operation~FDMisc" target="_blank">API Docs ↗</a>

This page could also have a CTA that pre-fills user choices like amount/tenure etc. and invokes the FD booking SDK. <a  href="https://www.figma.com/proto/SZBvpan3WFFsKnvM36Pn1v/New-FD-design?page-id=11519%3A0&node-id=13451%3A5032&viewport=78%2C341%2C0.61&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=13451%3A5032&show-proto-sidebar=1" target="_blank">Here</a> is the ideal end-to-end user journey with the SDK integration.

### Create a fixed deposit dashboard

On completing the FD booking journey, you will receive a webhook notification with status as `FINISH`. The webhook notification will have all the data required to create such a page, using details like <strong>invested amount, maturity amount, rate of interest, maturity date</strong> and more.
