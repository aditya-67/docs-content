### How it works

This section is meant for distributor partners. Supply partners may require bespoke integrations depending on their individual technical configurations.

Here is a typical list of steps involved in booking an FD by a retail investor. In this scenario, the distributor app has onboarded a banking partner with Setu’s Deposit SDK.

1. The customer opens a distributor partners app and chooses any of the supply partners to invest in.
2. The customer chooses an amount to invest and a tenure of their choice, and views the expected return on the maturity of the FD.
3. The customer fills out KYC details and personal information.
4. The customer then pays using any payment method of their choice (UPI, Netbanking, etc).
5. This payment directly goes to the supply partner, or maybe routed via Setu’s own payment gateway infrastructure.
