## Frequently asked questions

Read on to understand more about our Deposits product, through the questions we most commonly encounter from businesses that want to integrate with us.

##### Is booking an FD on this platform any different than booking an FD from Banking channels directly (via a branch or online) in terms of validity and security of the FD?

No, the FD that is booked through the platform is just as valid and safe as booking an FD from Banking channels directly (via a branch or online). Your money goes to Bajaj Finserv Bank directly & an FD is booked in your name on their system.

##### What if I need money urgently & need to close my FD before maturity?

No problem! You can close your FD by visiting your closest Bank Branch. If you redeem your FD before maturity, the interest rate applicable will depend on how many days you held the FD for. Of course, you will get your full principal amount at all times.
