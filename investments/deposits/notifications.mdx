## Configure notifications

Webhooks can be configured to listen to user events such as real-time application status, once the user starts the Fixed Deposit booking journey. This can be used for analytics and re-engagement purposes.

<Callout type="tip">
  Notifications have to be configured on The Bridge in Step 2 of configuration
  and is optional
</Callout>

<hr className="tertiary" />

### Set up process

##### Provide callback URL

Set up a callback URL that is capable of receiving real-time notifications.

<br />

##### Supported auth schemes

We support 3 forms of auth scheme for your callback URL server —

1. **None** – Open Endpoint without any authentication.
2. **JWT** – Signed JWT based authentication i.e. JWT token in Authorization Header. `client-id` and `secret` should be configured on Bridge. JWT generation URLs along with payload need to be communicated offline to Setu by writing to deposits.biz@setu.co.
3. **Basic** – Username and Password based authentication.

The authentication scheme can be customised for enterprise customers — please write to us at deposits.biz@setu.co

Each notification is a JSON with the following key value pairs —

- `amount`: amount being invested in the fixed deposit

- `email`: email id of the user, same as provided while generating the SDK token
- `phone`: phone number provided by the user during the booking journey
- `state`: state of the application in the FD booking journey. See the list of application states below for a detailed explanation.
