## Quickstart

Here is a quick summary of steps to help you integrate with Setu’s AA sandbox. Before you start, there are some key terms that will be referred to periodically in the documentation—

- **AA** or Account Aggregator—An entity licensed to show financial data requests to a customer and manage consent approvals/rejections. Setu partners with licensed AAs and offers pre-built, themeable screens to present data requests to your customers.
- **FIU** or Financial Information User—The entity requesting for data from its customers, i.e., you.
- **FIP** or Financial Information Provider—The entity that you request the financial data from, like a bank or an insurance provider. On staging, you can fetch data from Setu FIP.
- **FI types / data sources**—The types of financial data you can request for, from your customers. You can specify this on the Bridge.
- **Consent object/request**—This is core of the AA framework, wherein you (the FIU) request for consent from your customer to use one or more FI types. As part of the consent object, you would need to provide details like the reason for data request, how many times the data would be fetched etc. You can read more on the details that are sent as part of consent request <a href="/data/account-aggregator/consent-object" target="_blank">here</a>.
- **Request signing**—Def goes here

### Provide FIU details to Setu

Provide the following details to the Setu team—

- Share the notification endpoint, where we will send you alerts
- Share the UI color scheme and logo URL for your app, which may also be tweaked later

### Start integration with Sahmati

Setu will set up the right infrastructure for you to start Sahamati integration. This could take up to 48 hours. Here is what the process looks like—

- Setu generates key pair for the FIU, for request signing
- Setu shares FIU ID, public key and other information like IPs, ports, endpoints with Sahamati.
- We will generate and share a secret key for the web redirection used by you.
- We will deploy the FIU service, with a subdomain which is configured on our API gateway.
- We generate a Postman collection and API token for you
  Finally, we will reach out to you via email to start working on what the user experience will be for your customers.

### Start API integration on Sandbox

Here’s a quick overview of our APIs—

- **Create consent request**—Define the consent detail object. You will get the consent manager URL in the response of this API. Use this to mimic the experience for your user—login, link your accounts, approve consent.
- **Get consent request status**—This is an optional API for you to use when
- **Create new data session**—
- **Get the data session**—

### Get certified for production access

To become a part of the Account Aggregator Ecosystem, merchant FIUs need to adhere to certain technical standards prescribed by ReBIT. The Sahamati Certification Framework comprises a set of tests that all AA ecosystem participants go through, to enable verification of their adherence to the ReBIT-prescribed Technical standards. These include—

Cost of certification : (Billed by Setu)
Setu to specify the FIU endpoint with Aujas, run the tests, and issue a certificate for this FIU ID.
Setu submits certificate and FIU license info to Sahamati.
Once prod access is enabled, FIU developers can create consents against prod AAs, link real bank accounts and fetch data.

And it’s done! Now you should be able to make production calls once the prod key-pair is configured and you can switch between UAT and live environment for developing your flow!
