# Migration Guide

Setu's AA sandbox provided FIU developers to understand the AA ecosystem, build use-cases around it using the mock data that Setu provided. Now it's time for an update!

The current updated version provides FIUs to get registered with Sahamati, a collective set up for the AA ecosystem, be certified in the ecosystem, and actually get real-life data to build use-cases. This version also works with all the certified AAs in the ecosystem. The number of API calls and the time of integration has gone down two-fold.

## Updates

###### Handles API complexity—

- **Request signing**

  - FIUs need not go through the hassle of request signing on its end
  - Generating the necessary keys and signing the request on behalf of FIU, so that developers can work on important things.

- **End-to-end encryption**

  - FIUs need not generate keys for end-to-end encryption and decrypt data on its end.
  - The current version will generate necessary keys and send back decrypted data to the FIU

###### Handles certification/compliance complexity—

- FIU service is pre-certified, audited for go-live

###### Handles AA interop complexity—

- FIU service works with all AAs, like a payment gateway
