## FIU onboarding and go live

To be onboarded on the Account Aggregator ecosystem as an FIU (Financial information User), entities must undergo certification as laid out by **Sahamati (Central registry for Account Aggregator ecosystem participants)**.

<br />

#### Certification by Sahamati

Certification by Sahamati is done as a part of onboarding, in order to—

- Ensure FIUs adhere to technical standards prescribed by ReBIT (RBI’s technical wing)
- Ensure all AAs, FIUs and FIPs are interoperable
- Build trust amongst participants of the AA ecosystem as well as end users

<Callout type="highlight">
  Setu, as a Technical Service Provider (TSP), absorbs the certification
  complexity and completes the onboarding process on behalf of the FIU. To
  complete the certification, Setu has partnered with Aujas, who is a Sahamati
  empanelled certifier.
