## Quickstart

Here is a quick summary of steps to help you integrate with Setu’s AA. Before you start, there are some key terms that will be referred to periodically in the documentation—

- **AA** or Account Aggregator—An entity licensed to show financial data requests to a customer and manage consent approvals/rejections. Setu partners with licensed AAs and offers pre-built, themeable screens to present data requests to your customers.
- **FIU** or Financial Information User—The entity requesting for data from its customers, i.e., you.
- **FIP** or Financial Information Provider—The entity that you request the financial data from, like a bank or an insurance provider. On staging, you can fetch data from Setu FIP.
- **FI types / data sources**—The types of financial data you can request for, from your customers. You can specify this on the Bridge.
- **Consent object/request**—This is core of the AA framework, wherein you (the FIU) request for consent from your customer to use one or more FI types. As part of the consent object, you would need to provide details like the reason for data request, how many times the data would be fetched etc. You can read more on the details that are sent as part of consent request <a href="/data/account-aggregator/consent-object" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Step 2 — Download the Postman collection

Click on **Run in Postman** button on the top right corner of the <a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16080598/TzzBoun5" target="_blank">API reference</a> to import the Setu FIU’s API collection. Set the Postman collection environment to **Setu Environment**.

<br />

**Update environment variables**

<Callout type="tip">
  To edit environment variables in Postman, click on the eye icon to the top
  right and then <strong>Edit</strong>.
</Callout>

<br />

Head to The Bridge, and open you FIU app configuration. Update the following variables in the **Setu environment** on Postman

- Use the **client_api_key** value shown in the FIU app credentials as `client_api_key` in Postman.
- Copy-paste the request signing **private key in PEM format** to `signing_private_key` (this is the key you would have saved while generating your <a href="/data/account-aggregator/request-signing" target="_blank">request signing</a> key pair).
- Set `phone_number` to the user's mobile number that will be used for testing.

Hit **Save** after all the changes are complete.

### Step 3 — Implement the API flow

Look at the <a href="/data/account-aggregator/quickstart/apis" target="_blank">API integration</a> guide to start testing and implementing AA APIs. The APIs can be broken down into 3 broad flows—

- **Consent flow**—To create and share data consent requests with your customer, along with handling of approvals/rejections.
- **Data fetch flow**—To request for and fetch the data, if your customer approved the consent request.
- **Notifications flow**—To receive notifications from Setu for key events like approval/rejection of consent or be notified when FI data is ready to be fetched.

The following flowchart gives a quick snapshot of how the overall API flow works. The steps marked in

Additionally, there are two test environments for you to comprehensively test the AA flow—

##### Sandbox

This is a mock environment provided by Setu, and mimics all scenarios you would encounter in the live environment but instead with mock data. This way, you can get a predictable integration experience for when you eventually go live.

##### UAT

<Badge type="warning">COMING SOON</Badge>
This it the sandbox environment made available by Sahamati, the governing body that
oversees all AAs. UAT credentials are issued only after registering with Sahamati
and evaluating your FIU application. You can integrate with this, once integration
on Setu sandbox is complete.
