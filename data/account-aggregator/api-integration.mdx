## API integration

Setu’s AA APIs can be broken down into 3 broad flows—

- **Consent flow**—To create and share data consent requests with your customers, along with handling of approvals/rejections.
- **Data fetch flow**—To request for and fetch the data, once your customer has approved the consent request.
- **Notifications flow**—To receive notifications from Setu for key events like approval/rejection of consent or be notified when FI data is ready to be fetched.

Before starting integration, familiarise yourself with <a href="/data/account-aggregator/consent-object" target="_blank">**Consent Object**</a> which would act as a binding contract for all your data pulls.
