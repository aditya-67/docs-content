## Embed Setu screens

Setu’s screens provide a pre-built UI for the consent manager application, where your customer can approve or reject consent requests.

You can theme these screens according to your brand colors and logo. Once you make the Create Consent request, a `url` is returned which can easily be embedded as a webview or be used to redirect from a website. The URL is of the form:

`https://< fiu-base-url >/consents/webview/< consent-request-id >`

- **< fiu-base-url >** — This is the base URL of the FIU service provided by Setu.
- **< consent-request-id >** — This is the request ID of the consent generated returned after the create consent request.

The create consent request also takes a `redirectUrl`. Once the approval/rejection flow has been completed by the user, Setu redirects back to the specified `redirectUrl` with some query params:

- **success** — This is a boolean representing whether the approval was successful or not. (`true` for approved and `false` for rejection)
- **id** — Request ID of the consent
- **errorcode** — This is the error code representing the reason for failure. Sent only if `success = false`.

The redirect URL can be configured separately for each consent request, and would also send back any query params that you already have in the URL.

Please find the below integration steps to embed Setu’s consent manager screens into your application.

### Website

Redirect your customer to consent manager `url` received after Create Consent request. Once your customer has approved or rejected consent, this final screen in the consent manager will show a button that will redirect your customer to the `redirectUrl` provided by you in the Create consent API.<a href="https://staging.docs.setu.co/data/account-aggregator/api-integration/consent-flow#create-consent-api" target="_blank"></a>

### React Native

For cross-platform apps built using React Native, Setu’s consent manager can be embedded into the app using a web view. This web view loads the consent manager inside your app.

Below are the steps to embed the consent manager into React Native app,

- Implement a web view. Setu uses the WebView component from <a href="https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview" target="_blank">react-native-webview</a> library. You’re free to choose any other library for implementing this.

- Pass the consent manager URL into the `uri` parameter on the WebView component. Ideally, this URL can be sent as a parameter from the previous screen to the WebView screen.

- WebView component exposes a function `onNavigationStateChange` which is called every time there is a change in the navigation of web view.

- Use this function to check if the current navigation state URL of the web view is the same as the redirect URL you passed in consent manager URL. If yes, you can intercept that and change the screen from web view to a different screen in your app.
