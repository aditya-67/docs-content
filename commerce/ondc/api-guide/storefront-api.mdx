## Storefront APIs

The **Storefront** resource defines geographic locations for inventory storage and operations—like, warehouses or customer facing stores—via which order fulfilment is done.

The **Storefront APIs** can be use to—

1. Create a storefront for a seller <Badge>Mandatory</Badge>
2. Get details for a storefront
3. Update details for a storefront
4. Delete a storefront

### Create a storefront for a seller

This API creates a new storefront instance for a seller. Please note that a seller should already exist (using the **Create seller API**), as a storefront can only exist against a seller.

Few things to note while invoking this API -

1. Only call this API with a valid `setu_seller_id` and a unique `storefront_id`
2. The categories associated with the storefront can only be a subset of those mentioned for the associated seller. For e.g., if the associated seller operates in `F&B` and `Grocery` categories, then the storefront can specify `F&B` or `Grocery` or both.
3. `pickup_details` signifies the geographic location of the storefront. These details are visible throughout the ONDC network.
   1. `pickup_lat` and `pickup_long` are optional, but can be used combination with `radius` to define serviceability for hyperlocal deliveries. If you choose to define serviceability in terms of radius then also specify the storefront’s `pickup_lat` and `pickup_long` .
4. It is possible that a storefront has different billing details as compared to its associated seller. For e.g., franchises of a seller. So, we have allowed unique billing details per storefront. However, if your storefronts don’t have different billing details you can repeat the same details across all storefronts.
5. `business_hours` is used to define the operational hours of the storefront. You can choose to have as many opening and closing slots for a day. However, do make sure your opening and closing time is logically consistent, say the opening time should always be before closing time.
6. The `accept_orders_outside_business_hours` is used very closely with `business_hours`. Many eCommerce seller would like to accept 24/7 even though their storefront might not be operational 24/7. For such cases, set the `"accept_orders_outside_business_hours": true`
7. `fulfilment` currently only accepts `SELF_SHIP` i.e. the seller app procures it’s own logistics.
8. `serviceability` should either be defined using `radius` or a list of serviceable `pincodes` . `serviceability` cannot be defined on both `radius` and `pincodes`. Sellers operate in the hyperlocal context would typically like to define their serviceability using `radius` whereas sellers operating in the intercity context would like to define their serviceability using `pincodes` . Lastly, users will only be show the storefront’s catalogue if the storefront services their location.
