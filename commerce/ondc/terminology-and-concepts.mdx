## Terminology and concepts

In this section we’ll introduce the core resources that a user of this API collection interacts with during their lifecycle. The ONDC Seller Gateway consists of 6 key resources -

1. **Seller**
2. **Storefront**
3. **Catalogue**
4. **Catalogue Item**
5. **Order**
6. **Order Item**

Each of these resources have a set of allowed CRUD operations that you can perform on them. Here, we take a look at these resources and see how they’re related to each other.

### Tl;DR

**Sellers** sell goods and services via many **Storefronts** in different locations. Each **Storefronts** has a single product **Catalogue** consisting of multiple **Catalogue Items**. **Orders** are placed to **Storefronts** and can contain one or more Order Items, which always come from the Storefront’s corresponding **Catalogue Items**, listed in its **Catalogue**.

### Seller

The **Seller** resource is used to define the legal entity that is responsible for selling goods and services on ONDC. A seller may have one or more **Storefronts**, to provide this service.

### Storefront

The **Storefront** resource defines the geographic locations for inventory storage and operations— like warehouses or customer facing stores—via which order fulfilment is done.

A single Seller can have “n” **Storefronts**.

/>

Next, every Storefront has a **Catalogue** of products.

### Catalogue

The **Catalogue** resource is used to define the list of products available at a single **Storefront**, (with its own unique inventory), rather than defining it for a **Seller**.

So, a single **Storefront** has a single **Catalogue**.

  alt="storefront-to-catalogue"
/>

And next, a Catalogue contains one or more Catalogue Items.

### Catalogue Item

The **Catalogue Item** resource is used to define a single product belonging to a **Catalogue**, and can be uniquely identified and linked to a single **Catalogue**.

A **Catalogue** contains “n” **Catalogue Items**.

  alt="seller-to-storefront"
/>

Now, **Orders** can be placed which are made up of one or more **Catalogue Items**.

### Order

The **Order** resource is used to define an ONDC-routed order placed to a single **Storefront**. And this means a **Storefront** can accept “n” **Orders**.

  loading="lazy"
  src="https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-assets/latest/storefront-order/storefront-order.png"
  alt="storefront-to-order"
/>

And finally, an **Order** is made of one or more **Order Items**.

### Order Item

The **Order Item** resource is used to define a single product belonging to an **Order**. In e-commerce circles, this may commonly be called a “line item”.

A single **Order** contains “n” **Order Items**.

  alt="order-to-order-item"
/>

It is important to note that a buyer can only order items that are present in a **Storefront’s** **Catalogue**, meaning that, one **Order Item** always corresponds to one **Catalogue Item**.

### Final takeaways

1. A single **Seller** has “n” **Storefronts**
2. A single **Storefront** always has a single **Catalogue**
3. A single **Catalogue** has “n” **Catalogue Items**
4. A single **Storefront** can get “n” **Orders**
5. A single **Order** can have “n” **Order Items**
6. A single **Order Item** always maps to a single **Catalogue Item**
