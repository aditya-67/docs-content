## Collection Journey

For WhatsApp collection journeys, the customer discovers your WhatsApp business number and starts a conversation. The customer will be taken through a conversational collection journey through which the customer can make a payment.

<hr class="primary" />

### Discovery of business number

The customer can discover your WhatsApp number in different ways. Some of the recommended ways are listed below.

##### WhatsApp Deeplink

WhatsApp officially supports a special type of URL called WhatsApp Deeplink. When the customer clicks on this link, they will be taken to the chat window of your Business number. The text box on the chat can be automatically filled with text of your choice and the customer can immediately start the conversation.

The WhatsApp Deeplinks can be sent to your customer in an SMS campaign or can even be embedded on your websites.

Setu will help you create such WhatsApp Deeplinks for your business number.

Here’s a standard payment flow on a <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=919019702176&text=bill&app_absent=0" target="_blank">sample WhatsApp Deeplink</a> created by Setu—try it out yourself.

##### QR Code

WhatsApp Deeplinks can be encoded in the form of QR codes and WhatsApp natively provides an option to scan the QR code and start the conversation.

These QR codes can be used in your physical branches and can be part of the print or digital advertising campaigns you run. Setu will help you create customised QR code with your logo on it.

Below is a QR code created by Setu using the previously shared sample WhatsApp Deeplink. Scan and try out the flow—

### How to get started?

##### Step 1 — Start KYC and business documentation

Once Setu’s Sales team has interacted with you and confirmed integration, you can get started with KYC and review legal agreements—

1. Add KYC and business contact details (KYC varies as per your business category)
2. Sign legal agreements—the SOP agreement with Setu and Pricing agreement.

##### Step 2 — Link your BSP to Setu account

The WhatsApp business account set up via a BSP is what your customers interact with. Setu actively maintains integrations with all top BSPs in the country.

  register for a new one.

##### Step 3 — Finalise the collection journey

Setu works with BSP partners to bring your collection journey to life, with defined message templates. Setu will help you get templates whitelisted via your BSP, once you confirm message content.

##### Step 4 — Share customer bills

You need to share your customers’ bills with Setu, to allow your customers to fetch bills. If you are already a BBPS biller, you can integrate with our <a href="/payments/whatsapp-collect/api-integration#option-2---fetch-latest-bill" target="_blank">fetch bill APIs</a> right away.

If you’re not registered as biller, contact Setu for more details on how to get started.

##### Step 5 — Go live and start collections

Go live and can start tracking your live transactions on The Bridge. Refer to <a href="/dev-tools/bridge/reports" target="_blank">this guide</a> on how to use reports.
