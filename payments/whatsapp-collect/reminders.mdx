## Collection Reminders

Using Setu WhatsApp Reminders, you can push an interactive bill reminder to your customer on WhatsApp. You'll be able to connect your existing WhatsApp Business number provisioned by any BSP to send the bill.

This interactive bill contains an embedded payment link through which the user can pay in 3 simple steps.

### How to get started?

##### Step 1 — Start KYC and business documentation

This is started once Setu’s Sales team has interacted with you and confirmed integration. You will need to add a few details and review agreements—

1. Add KYC and business contact details (KYC varies as per your business category)
2. Sign legal agreements—the SOP agreement with Setu and Pricing agreement.

##### Step 2 — Link your BSP to Setu account

The WhatsApp business account set up via a BSP is what your customers interact with. Setu actively maintains integrations with all top BSPs in the country.

##### Step 3 — Whitelist the message templates

The reminder messages follow defined template(s) for all your customers. Setu will help you get templates whitelisted via your BSP, once you confirm message content. Please refer <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18tHWMU0IByxB6rCPIv6oDPUnM5eAlsm-7wqY8WWlKRs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> for Setu recommended templates.

##### Step 4 — Share customer bills

You need to share your customers’ bills with Setu, to send payment reminders to customers. Integrate with our <a href="/payments/whatsapp-collect/api-integration" target="_blank">send bill APIs</a> for this.

##### Step 5 — Go live and start collections

Go live and can start tracking your live transactions on The Bridge. Refer to <a href="/dev-tools/bridge/reports" target="_blank">this guide</a> on how to use reports.

### Recommended use cases

WhatsApp collections are most effective when they are linked to a trigger. Setu recommends integrating these APIs with the following systems.

- Field Agent Collection Portal—Convert your cash collection to digital via WhatsApp
- Call center/IVR—Augment your call center efficiency through automated WhatsApp bill reminders
- CRM/LMS—Trigger bill reminders based on set business logic

Apart from these recommended use cases, you can still leverage our APIs to integrate with any system of your choice.
