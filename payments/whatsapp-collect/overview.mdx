## WhatsApp Collect

### What are WhatsApp Business APIs?

In 2018, WhatsApp released Business APIs that allow businesses to serve their customers via their WhatsApp accounts. Businesses can use these APIs to build various customer experiences.

With Setu WhatsApp Collect, you can start collecting payments via WhatsApp.

### How can I use this product?

At Setu, we classify WhatsApp Collect into two product constructs—

- **Collection Reminders**, where you can send reminders to your customers for any payment to be collected from them.
- **Collection Journey**, where your customer can initiate a WhatsApp chat to fetch their latest outstanding bill with your business.

For either alternative, a customer can initiate their payment, right from WhatsApp and use any available UPI app on their phone to complete payment.
