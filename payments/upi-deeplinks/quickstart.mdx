## UPI Quickstart

As the first step, sign up on <a href="https://bridge.setu.co/" target="_blank">The Bridge</a>, if you haven’t already. This is where you can create product configurations and add configuration details. Read more on this <a href="/dev-tools/bridge/overview" target="_blank">here</a> and watch <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/fed32a838e7f400294f543c9dc8c5779" target="_blank">this quick video</a> on how to create a test merchant configuration.

Also, listed below are some other details you need to get started. If you do face any issues, [raise a support ticket](https://support.setu.co/support/tickets/new) and our team will reach out.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### API URLs

-   Sandbox `https://uat.setu.co/api`
-   Production `https://prod.setu.co/api`

<Callout type="warning">
    Please note that if you are using **OAuth** as your preferred authentication
    method, the API URL will need to be updated. The sandbox URL would become
    <code>https://uat.setu.co/api/v2</code> and production URL would be
    <code>https://prod.setu.co/api/v2</code>
</Callout>

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Header

These will be applicable to all APIs you call, unless specified otherwise—

-   `X-Setu-Product-Instance-ID`—this is a unique identifier for your merchant configuration set up on the Bridge. Look for the “Merchant ID” on the top left, inside your merchant configuration.
    ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-assets/latest/Image_For_Merchant_ID_5a5c68ba56/Image_For_Merchant_ID_5a5c68ba56.png)
-   `authorization`—Bearer <**insert_token_here**>. Generate this token using <a href="/payments/upi-deeplinks/resources/oauth" target="_blank">OAuth</a> or <a href="/payments/upi-deeplinks/resources/jwt" target="_blank">JWT</a>.
-   `Content-Type`—will be `application/json`. This will not be present in the header for Check link status API.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### List of APIs

-   Create UPI payment link
-   Add credit (mock a payment in Sandbox)
-   Get notified via webhook (by exposing an endpoint)
-   Check link status (_optional_)
-   Expire Bill (_optional_)

### Start integration

##### Step 1 — Create a merchant configuration

See this <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/fed32a838e7f400294f543c9dc8c5779" target="_blank">quick video</a> on how to create a merchant configuration on The Bridge Sandbox.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Step 2 — Add configuration details

Under the “Configuration” tab—

&nbsp;

**Add URL endpoint**

The `callbackURL`—for Setu to send notifications for payment and settlment success. If you want to implement this, read more about <a href="notifications" target="_blank">notifications</a>.

<Callout type="warning">
    Please note, Setu will add <code>/notifications</code> at the end of this
    URL.
</Callout>{" "}

<br />

Set up authentication details as per your preference to expose `callbackURL`. Add details on The Bridge and <a href="https://support.setu.co/support/tickets/new" targrt="_blank">contact Setu's team</a>, if needed. Note that you can also add multiple callback URLs, as per your requirements.

**Add settlement account(s)**

A settlement account has to be added to allow mock settlements while making test transactions. Any dummy value could be added here.

###### Sample request

Let’s create a payment link for INR 100. This is what the request and response would look like.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
    "billerBillID"    : "EB-1123-345324",
    "amount": {
        "value"        : 10000,
        "currencyCode" : "INR"
    },
    "amountExactness" : "EXACT", //ENUM values—EXACT | EXACT_DOWN | ANY
    "name" : "Merchant name", //specify this optionallly
    "transactionNote": "Payment for ABC bill", //optional
    "additionalInfo" : {
        "UUID": "jlkjdfl-ahaklsj-alsdjklj",
        "tags": "electricity"
    }
} `}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

**In the above request:**

-   `billerBillID` is an identifier for this link in merchant’s system which they will later look up or reconcile against.
-   `amount.value` is the value in **paise** of the amount needed to be collected from the user, expressed as data type `integer`
-   `amount.currencyCode` would always be `INR`.
-   `amountExactness` allows flexibility in the amount being paid by the customer, as per merchant specification.
    -   Specifying `EXACT` will allow your customer to pay only the exact amount specified by you in the create link API.
    -   Specifying `ANY` will simply allow your customer to pay any amount above INR 1.
    -   Specifying `EXACT_DOWN` will only allow the paid amount to be more than INR 1 and less than the amount specified in the Create bill API.

Note that UPI does not recognise a “maximum allowed amount” and any payment value above INR 1 will be successful with `EXACT_DOWN`.

However, paying more than the amount specified in the Create bill API will fail Setu’s validation, and will be refunded to your customer. See **Validations** below.

<Callout type="warning">
    <code>amountExactness</code> is not honoured consistently across UPI apps.
    As explained above, failure against the <code>amountExactness</code> logic
    on Setu may cause a successful payment to trigger a refund for the customer.
    Hence, we recommend setting <code>EXACT</code> for{" "}
    <code>amountExactness</code>, for higher predictability.
</Callout>

<br />

-   `name` is an optional parameter using which you may specify the payee’s name when payment is being done. By default this is the name of the merchant as set up on the Bridge.
-   `transactionNote` is an optional parameter through which you can set the message for when a customer is making a UPI payment. By default the transaction note is “**Payment for {your `billerBillID`}**”.
-   `additionalInfo` is an optional object where you can pass any key, value—Setu will send it back in the payment successful notification. You can use this to define any details that you do not otherwise receive as part of the notification.

This request to generate a link is flexible and allows for many use cases. To know more about all the API params, please refer to the API documentation <a href="/payments/upi-deeplinks/api-reference#/category~APIs_to_call/operation~paymentLink" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Validations**

You may additionally set up checks for transaction to be considered successful.

Currently we have two types of supported validations, that you as a merchant can specify—

-   **Amount based check**—This is used to specify an acceptable range of payment amounts to consider a payment successful and can be set via the `AMOUNT_EXACTNESS` condition that is explained above.
-   **Source account check**—This is a flag you can set while integrating with us, and use it to specify a bank account that you expect the customer to pay from. If you opt for this, you can mention the expected bank account from which the customer can pay in the <a href="/payments/upi-deeplinks/refunds#tpv-check-by-setu" target="_blank"><code>sourceAccounts</code> object</a> as part of the Create payment link API.

Read more on how <a href="/payments/upi-deeplinks/refunds#setu-initiated-refunds" target="_blank">refunds</a> will be handled in case these validations are not met.

###### Sample response

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
    "status": 200,
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "name": "Test Link generator",
        "paymentLink": {
            "shortURL": "https://bills.pe/yH9c9",
            "upiID": "test464618891939677612@kaypay",
            "upiLink": "upi://pay?pa=test464618891939677612@kaypay&pn=Test+Link+generator&am=100.00&tr=EB-1123-345324&tn=Payment+for+EB-1123-345324&cu=INR"
        },
        "platformBillID": "464618891939677612"
    }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

**In the above response:**

-   `shortURL`can be shared directly with customers via a communication channel.
-   `upiLink` can be used as an Android button target (what is typically known as an intent trigger) or to generate a QR code that can be scanned with any UPI enabled app.
-   `upiID` would typically not be needed but a merchant may want to share this ID directly with the customer as a last resort in case none of the above 2 methods work - remember that the UX of this would not be good at all.
-   `platformBillID` is a unique ID that is associated with this link and can be used to track it later.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Add credit (mock a payment in Sandbox)

A mock payment against a link can be triggered to recreate a successful payment by a customer.

<Callout type="tip">
    Setu recommends using this via Postman and to not waste resources on
    integrating this in code, unless there is a specific requirement to do so
    (such as automations and tests at your end).

###### Sample request

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
  "amount": 100,
  "type": "UPI",
  "destinationAccount": {
    "accountID": "test464618891939677612@kaypay"
  },
  "sourceAccount": {
    "accountID": "dummy_customer@vpa"
  }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

**In the above request:**

-   `amount` is the value in **rupees** of the amount the link was generated for, expressed as data type `float` or `double`
-   `destinationAccount.accountID` is the `upiID` generated above.
-   `sourceAccount.accountID` is the VPA from which the payment is made - any dummy value can be used here, which is in a valid VPA format.

The response would simply be `200 OK` without any body.

##### Get notified via webhook

As soon as a customer makes a successful payment (or mocks a payment), Setu triggers a near realtime notification via webhook mechanism (also called callback).

For this to work, Setu expects the merchant to expose an API endpoint URL ending in `/notifications`. Once this URL is configured on Setu, the merchant starts receiving notifications.

###### Sample notification

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
    "partnerDetails": {
        "appID": "string",  // your unique app ID in Setu system, this is constant
        "productInstanceID": "string"  // your unique product instance ID in Setu system, this is constant
    },
    "events": [
        {
            "data": {
                    "amountPaid": {  // amount paid by the user in paisa
                        "currencyCode" : "INR",
                        "value"        : 10000
                    },
                    "billerBillID"    : "EB-1123-345324", // same as the billerBillID set by you when creating the link
                    "platformBillID": "string",  // same as the platformBillID received by you when creating the link
                    "amountExactness" : "EXACT",
                    "additionalInfo" : { // same as values defined when creating the link
                        "UUID": "jlkjdfl-ahaklsj-alsdjklj",
                        "tags": "electricity"
                    },
                    "status": "PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL",
                    "payerVpa": "string",
                    "transactionId": "string",
            },
            "timeStamp": 1595325201265,
            "type": "BILL_FULFILMENT_STATUS",
            "id": "fc4d3128-b6f4-46a5-8275-f5c05e0025b4"
        }
    ]
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

**In the above request:**

-   `partnerDetails` are unique IDs corresponding to the merchant.
-   `events` is an array of events, which will usually contain only a single event.
-   `events.type` is the event type - where the relevant type would be `BILL_FULFILMENT_STATUS`.
-   `events.timestamp` is the epoch timestamp of the event.
-   `events.id` is unique callback ID for every event, used for logging, debugging and tracking.

The response should simply be `200 OK` without any body.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Check link status (optional)

This API does a status check on payment done against a link. It should not be used for polling but only for specific use cases.

For example, if someone waiting for a customer to pay within 5 minutes (300 seconds) doesn’t receive a callback within that time—they can use this API to check payment status and mark link as “invalid”, so that it is not used again.

**In the above response:**

-   `amountPaid.value` is the amount paid by the customer in paise.
-   `createdAt` and `expiresAt` represent the link creation and validity timestamps, respectively. The validity is set to 45 days 0 hours (meaning the time will be same as for link creation) by default, but can be customised.
-   `paymentLink` contains the same info as in Create UPI payment link API’s response.
-   `status` represents the status of the link.

-   A UPI link can take multiple paths depending on the success and failure at different steps. Accordingly, the status journeys of a UPI link can be mapped as follows.

    -   An ideal status flow (where user pays successfully and money is settled to merchant account) for a UPI payment link is:
        `BILL_CREATED > PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL > CREDIT_RECEIVED > SETTLEMENT_SUCCESSFUL`

    -   In case a user doesn't pay or the payment is unsuccessful due to any reason between user's UPI app and user's bank:
        `BILL_CREATED > BILL_EXPIRED`
    -   In case payment fails due to an error on Setu (such as amount validation):
        `BILL_CREATED > PAYMENT_FAILED`

    -   In case of settlement related issues:
        `BILL_CREATED > PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL > CREDIT_RECEIVED > SETTLEMENT_FAILED`

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Expire Bill (optional)

Use the expire bill API to assign the `BILL_EXPIRED` status to the bill associated with your link. An expiry here refers to 2 things:

-   Setting the bill state to `BILL_EXPIRED` in Setu's system
-   Expiring the shortlink associated with the bill

`platformBillID` is a unique identifier for a bill on Setu's system and has to be provided to expire the bill. This is made available in the Create Payment Link API's response.

</table>

###### Success

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
    "status": 200,
    "success": true
  }`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

###### Failure

In case the `platformBillID` provided is incorrect, Setu will respond with `404` resource not found error—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
    status: 404,
    success: false,
    error: {
      code: "bill-not-found",
      title: "Bill not found",
      detail: "Provided billId not found. Please re-check the billId.",
      docUrl: "",
      traceId: "XXXX"
    }
  }`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

If a bill has been expired, ideally, a payment by a customer would not be allowed, if verify VPA call returns an error on a payment app.

But if the verify VPA call was not made and the customer makes a payment, payment will go through but will be refunded in the settlement flow.
