### How it works

- A **Merchant** sends payment details to **Setu** and receives a unique payment link to send to their **Customer**.
- A **Customer** clicks the payment link, chooses preferred UPI app and enters mPIN to make a successful payment.
- Once the payment is successful, **Setu** triggers a webhook notification for the completed payment, which the merchant can use to update the transaction status at their end.
- Once payment is received **Setu** settles the amount to the **Merchant** as per the configured settlement timeline.
