## Go Live

Once you've tested your integration on The Bridge Sandbox environment with sample transactions, you can go live and accept payments from actual customers.

In case you face an issue with any of the following steps, [raise a support ticket](https://support.setu.co/support/tickets/new) and our team will reach out to you.

#### Step 3 — Add KYC details

Click on the “KYC” tab to see the list of details you need to add.

Our team may also reach out separately to collect a few more details offline, depending on your business category.

<hr class="primary" />

#### Step 4 — Submit for review

Click on the “Review” tab and “Submit for review”. Setu's Admin team needs to verify details submitted by you and also test your integration before you go live. Once your configuration has been approved, you will be notified by our team, and the “Review” tab will display this message— “_Your latest configuration is live in production_” and the configuration status will change to “LIVE”. You will start seeing transactions, once your customers make payments on the links generated by you.

###### A note on editing configuration after having gone live

You may modify the configuration and “Submit for review” again. On submission, you see a confirmation—“_You have submitted for review_”. The modified details will also be shown on the “Review” tab.

After submission is done, you can expect your configuration to be reviewed by a Setu admin within 2-3 days. Once review is successful, we enable the new configuration details on production. The “Review” tab will display this message— “_Your latest configuration is live in production_”.

Till the time the new details aren't approved by Setu, your older configuration will continue to work.
