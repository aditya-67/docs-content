## iOS integration

Setu provides ready to use URLs for iOS integration. Contact Setu to update your logo, colours, fonts as per your branding. You can reach out to <a href="">billpay.support@setu.co</a> for any further clarifications. This quickstart page provides the sample code for the following specs—

-   **Programming language** — Swift 5.\* (Latest version 5.3)
-   **Interface** — Storyboard
-   **Life Cycle delegation** — UI Kit
-   **iOS versions supported** — 12+ (Latest version 14.4)

<Callout type="tip">
    This quickstart provides the integration guidelines for iOS integration with
    Setu’s default UPI payment option. If you’d like to use your own payment
    gateway, please refer to{" "}
    <a href="/payments/billpay/custom-payment/iOS" target="_blank">
        this guide
    </a>{" "}
    instead.

### Step 1 — Implement web view in your app

The following steps need to be taken for webview integration—

1. Get link from the backend
2. Open a webview and attach the iOS interface

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Get link from the backend

This step gives a one time Setu URL to be used by your customer for the bill fetch or payment flow. The <a href="/payments/billpay/api-reference/white-label#/category~Link/operation~getLink" target="_blank">Create link API</a> needs to be called when the iOS app wants to obtain a one time link to load Setu’s screen flow inside a webview.

<Callout type="tip">
    None of the parameters aside from mobile number are mandatory, but depending
    on what is passed the returned link will display different UI.
</Callout>

You can have the following scenarios, depending on what you choose to send along with the customer’s mobile number—

-   If no other input is passed, it will take the user to the home page with all BBPS categories.
-   If category code is passed, it will show user a list of billers in that category.
-   If category code and biller ID is passed, it will show the bill fetch form where a customer can enter their identifers (biller specified parameters)
-   If the category code, biller ID and parameters are passed, it will show the bill directly.

<Callout type="warning">
    All query parameters should be url-encoded to escape special characters
</Callout>

<br />

The above request will return URL based on the input params. Here’s a sample—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`{
  "link": "https://cou-whitelabelled-dev.setu.co/cou/categories/5f1fb0db-b2ed-4222-bb2f-53d238df370a"
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Switch control from your app to Setu

The link returned by the API should be loaded within `WKWebView` in a `ViewController` which implements `UIViewController`, and `WKScriptMessageHandler`. The controller must also extend and use a custom `WKNavigationDelegate` class to intercept and download PDF files.

If you’re using a cross platform solution—like Flutter, React Native, Ionic—look at the code snippets provided <a href="/payments/billpay/quickstart/cross-platform" target="_blank">here</a>.

The `userContentController` will need to implement one function—

-   `unload` — Used by the parent app to dismiss the webview

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="bash">
{`// The iOS observer function
func userContentController(_ userContentController: WKUserContentController, didReceive message: WKScriptMessage) {
    guard let dict = message.body as ? [String: AnyObject]
    else {
        return
    }
    let functionToPerform: String = dict["function"] as ? String ?? ""
    
    switch functionToPerform {
        case "unload": closeView()
        default: break
    }
}`}

</CodeBlockWithCopy>

The `WKWebviewDownloadHelper` which downloads our PDF file is used as below

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="bash">
    {`override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  let mimeTypes = [MimeType(type: "pdf", fileExtension: "pdf")]
  helper = WKWebviewDownloadHelper(webView: webView, mimeTypes: mimeTypes, delegate: self)
  webView.configuration.userContentController.add(self, name: "ios_observer")
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

`WKWebviewDownloadHelper` is dependent on the custom `WKNavigationDelegate` class

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="bash">
    {`extension WebViewController: WKWebViewDownloadHelperDelegate {
  func fileDownloadedAtURL(url: URL) {
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
      let activityVC = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [url], applicationActivities: nil)
      activityVC.popoverPresentationController?.sourceView = self.view
      activityVC.popoverPresentationController?.sourceRect = self.view.frame
      activityVC.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem = self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem
      self.present(activityVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
  }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

### Step 2 — Optionally configure webhook

You may optionally want to listen to user events—like successful or failed bill fetch, bill payment status and more—through webhooks. Refer to <a href="/payments/billpay/user-events" target="_blank">this guide</a> for more information.

<hr class="primary" />

### Step 3 — Get Production credentials and go live Once you are done testing your

integration, ensure that all KYC and legal agreements are submitted. Contact Setu
for getting enabled on production.
