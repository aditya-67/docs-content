## Constructing a bill on Collect

##### How to customise the Setu bill object for any business use case

At the very core of Collect, is the Setu bill object. It facilitates a vast number of business scenarios—such as recurring payments for insurance premiums or school fee collections with multiple line items. It does this by having a generic, modular information structure that can be constructed to your needs.

Explore the full object on the <a href="/payments/bbps/api-reference" target="_blank">API reference ↗</a>.

<hr class="primary" />

### Basic bill structure

The `data` object houses 2 types of data—

-   `billDetails`—the components are explained in the following sections.
-   `customer`—these are the customer details required by NPCI, as per biller category. Read about <a href="bill-structure/special-cases" target="_blank">special cases ↗</a>.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`"data" : {
    "customer": {
        "name": "Shailesh"
    },
    "billDetails" : {
        "billFetchStatus" : "AVAILABLE",
        "bills" : [
            {
                "generatedOn"       : "2020-06-04T06:59:04Z" // bill generation / fee start date, 
                "dueDate"           : "2020-06-04T06:59:04Z" // last date for fee payment,  
                "recurrence"        : "ONE_TIME",  
                "amountExactness"   : "EXACT", 
                "billerBillID"      : "string",  // bill identifier, sent with each payment
                "customerAccount"   : {},
                "amount"            : {}, //amount against the bill
                "items"             : [], // array of line items
                "aggregates"        : {} // details on final amount that the customer needs to pay
            }
        ]
    }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<hr class="primary" />

### Bill components

In the bill object, the details are broken down into simple logical units, that follow the same pattern and structure where ever they appear.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Amount

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`"amount" : {
    "currencyCode" : "INR", // ISO 4217
    "value"        : 10000  // in paise, so this means 100 rupees
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

`amount` is made of two attributes—

-   `currencyCode` The currency used in the bill its three-letter ISO 4217 format.
-   `value` The money value of the bill, in paise.

This same object structure is re-used whenever there is a need to denote amounts against any item such as `fees`, `taxes`, `discounts` etc.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Items

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`"items" : [
    {
        "code"            : "string",
        "displayName"     : "string",
        "description"     : "string",
        "measurementUnit" : "ENUM",
        "quantity"        : 0,
        "unitPrice"       : {},
        "discounts"       : [],
        "fees"            : [],
        "taxes"           : [],
        "aggregates"      : 
        {
            "discount" : {},
            "subTotal" : {},
            "tax"      : {},
            "total"    : {}
        },
    }
]`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

This array is where the individual prices against services or products (for which the bill has been raised) are listed out.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Fees

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`"fees" : [
    {
        "quantity"    : 0,
        "displayName" : "string",
        "description" : "string",
        "unitCost"    : {},
        "discounts"   : [],
        "taxes"       : [],
        "aggregates"  : {
            "discount" : {},
            "subTotal" : {},
            "tax"      : {},
            "total"    : {}
        }
    }
]`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

The `fees` array is used to bundle information on any additional charges in the Setu bill object—for example, processing fees. It has a `taxes` child array component, which can be used to provide a breakdown of the individual tax elements on each of the fees elements.

The amounts against any item such as `taxes`, `discounts` replicate the same object structure as described in the `amount` object.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Taxes

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`"taxes" : [
    {
        "type"        : "string"
        "displayName" : "string",
        "amount"      : {},
        "computation" : {},
        "components"  : [
            {
                "type"        : "string",
                "displayName" : "string",
                "amount"      : {},
                "computation" : {},
            }
        ],
    }
]`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

The `taxes` array is used to bundle all the tax-related information in the Setu bill object. It has a `components` child, which can be used to provide a breakdown of the individual tax elements of the bill. This, in turn, contains a similar structure as the parent object, to be consistent.

The amounts against any item such as `taxes`, `discounts` replicate the same object structure as described in the `amount` object.
The `amount` and the `computation` objects displayed are replicated in the same way as within other objects.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Taxes

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`"taxes" : [
    {
        "type"        : "string"
        "displayName" : "string",
        "amount"      : {},
        "computation" : {},
        "components"  : [
            {
                "type"        : "string",
                "displayName" : "string",
                "amount"      : {},
                "computation" : {},
            }
        ],
    }
]`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

The `taxes` array is used to bundle all the tax-related information in the Setu bill object. It has a `components` child, which can be used to provide a breakdown of the individual tax elements of the bill. This, in turn, contains a similar structure as the parent object, to be consistent.

The amounts against any item such as `taxes`, `discounts` replicate the same object structure as described in the `amount` object.
The `amount` and the `computation` objects displayed are replicated in the same way as within other objects.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Computation

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`"computation" : {
    "currencyCode" : "string",
    "value"        : int,
    "method"       : "PERCENTAGE" | "VALUE",
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

Sometimes, values are calculated dynamically, and is dependant on the rest of the elements in the bill. This is where the `computation` object comes into the picture. It is very similar to the [`amount`](#amount) object, but with an additional `method` attribute which describes how that value was arrived at.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Aggregates

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`"aggregates" : {
    "itemQuantity" : {},
    "discount"     : {
        "displayName" : "string",
        "amount"      : {
            "currencyCode" : "string",
            "value"        : 0
        },
    },
    "fee"      : {},
    "tax"      : {},
    "subTotal" : {},
    "total"    : {}
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

The `aggregates` object is used to display the cumulative total value from all of the above components. Each of these attributes have the same structure—containing the [`amount`→](/collect/biller/bbps/bill-object#amount) object inside of them, along with the `displayName` string.

<hr class="tertiary" />

### Sample bill

Using all these components, we can now create a bill for a real-world use case. Let’s say you want to create for an EMI payment with the below details—

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                <h6>Line item</h6>
            </th>
            <th>
                <h6>Amount</h6>
            </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>EMI — June</td>
            <td>₹ 6000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>EMI — July</td>
            <td>₹ 6000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <h6>Total EMI</h6>
            </td>
            <td>
                <h6>₹ 12,000</h6>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Convenience fees</td>
            <td>₹ 15</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Late fees</td>
            <td>₹ 200</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <h5>Total payable</h5>
            </td>
            <td>
                <h5>₹ 12,215</h5>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<br />

Here, we need to process two line items for the EMIs, and two types of fees, and one total amount for the entire bill. The EMIs can be constructed using the `items` object, like so—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`"items" : [
    {
        "displayName" : "EMI — June",
        "description" : "Missed installment payment for June",
        "aggregates"  : {
            "total"   : {
                "currencyCode" : "INR",
                "value"        : 600000  // INR6000 in paise
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "displayName" : "EMI — July",
        "description" : "Installment for July",
        "aggregates"  : {
            "total"   : {
                "currencyCode" : "INR",
                "value"        : 600000  // INR6000 in paise
            }
        }
    }
]`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

And for the fees included, we can use the `fees` object, like so—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`"fees" : [
    {
        "displayName" : "Late fees",
        "description" : "Extra charge for missing the June payment",
        "aggregates"  : {
            "total"   : {
                "currencyCode" : "INR",
                "value"        : 20000  // in paise
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "displayName" : "Convenience fees",
        "description" : "Online processing charges",
        "aggregates"  : {
            "total"   : {
                "currencyCode" : "INR",
                "value"        : 1500  // in paise
            }
        }
    }
]`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

Filling the other attributes and putting it all together, the bill object now looks something like this—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`//  ENTIRE BILL OBJECT
{
    "billerBillID"    : "CXR5JEQO8K",
    "recurrence"      : "ONE_TIME",
    "generatedOn"     : "2019-07-27T12:56:39Z",
    "dueDate"         : "2019-08-26T12:56:39Z",
    "amountExactness" : "EXACT",
    "fees" : [
        <late fees object>,
        <convenience fees object>
    ],
    "items" : [
        <june fee object>,
        <july fee object>
    ],
    "customerAccount" : {
        "id" : "asha.dev@gmail.com"
    },
    "aggregates"      : {
        "subtotal" : {
            "amount" : {
                "displayName" : "EMI amount",
                "value"       : 1200000  // in paise
            }
        },
        "total": {
            "amount" : {
                "displayName" : "Total payable amount",
                "value"       : 1221500  // in paise
            }
        }
    }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

Finally, wrap the bill object in the following pattern, and send it across to us as the <a href="api-reference#/category~APIs_to_Implement/operation~fetchCustomerBills" target="_blank"><code>fetchCustomerBills</code>↗</a> response to Setu—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
    {`//  FETCH CUSTOMER BILLS API RESPONSE
{
    "status"  : 200,
    "success" : true,
    "data"    : {
        "customer" : {
            "name" : "Asha Dev"
        },
        "billDetails" : {
            "billFetchStatus" : "AVAILABLE",
            "bills" : [
                <bill object>
            ]
        }
    }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>
