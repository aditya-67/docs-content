# Axis BBPS API Approach Document

## Loan Category

2 APIs to be shared :

1. Bill Fetch API
2. Payment Posting API

### Authentication Measures

**Note: This section is not mandatory. This is just a mechanism to enhance API security.**

This is common to both APIs, the biller's team can include an Authentication mechanism to make sure only validated requests are entertained. We support a wide variety of authentication schemes including `Basic Auth`, `JWT`, `OAuth` etc. These auth tokens are included in the headers of every request to validate it.

We also support encrypted requests using Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption algorithms. Most common schemes include `AES` and `RSA` encryption. If encryption is implemented it is recommended to share the encryption logic while sharing the API spec for us to implement on our stack.

Another measure that can be taken is `IP Whitelisting`. We can hand over specific IPs from which we make request to the biller system to make sure only validated requests are entertained.

**HTTPS is mandatory for Prod deployment.**

### Bill Fetch API

This is sent by Setu system to biller system. Biller needs to handle 4 scenarios as given below :

1. Successful Fetch
2. Customer Not Found / Invalid identifier
3. No Amount Due / Payment already made
4. API Error / All other error scenarios

For loan cateogory some mandatory parameters include :

1. Customer Name
2. Amount
3. Bill Date
4. Due Date
5. Bill Period

Other parameters can also be added as `Additional Info`
eg. `Interest`, `Penalty` etc.

These parameters listed above must be a part of a successful fetch response (excluding additional info).

##### Sample Request

Request is made based on unique identifier selected by biller, in this case it can be `Loan Number`.

This is a sample `POST` request to some endpoint given by the biller's technical team. This can also be a simple `GET` request with `loan_number` as a Parameter.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "loan_number": "123456789",
    // any other identifier can be added here
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

**Note: loan_number is as per business use case and can be changed**

##### Success Response

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "errorCode" : "00",
    "customerName": "Ashok Kumar",
    "amountDue": "1290.20",
    "billDate" : "2021-07-15",
    "dueDate" : "2021-07-30",
    "billNumber" : "TUVW1234",
    "billPeriod" : "MONTHLY",
    "additionalInfo":{
        "interest": "value1", // Optional
        "penalty": "value2" // Optional
         // ... MAX 4
    }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

Points to consider :

1. billDate must not be future date ( wrt date of fetching the bill ) and must always be less then or equal to dueDate
2. Max 4 additional info parameters are allowed

##### Customer Not Found

Triggered when invalid credentials are entered. In this case when incorrect `loan_number` is entered by customer.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "status": "FAILURE",
    "errorCode" : "01"
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

##### No Amount Due

Triggered when payment has already been made for this particular set of identifiers.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "status": "FAILURE",
    "errorCode" : "02"
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

##### API Error

Triggered when any other issue occurs while making a request.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "status": "FAILURE",
    "errorCode" : "03"
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

### Payment Posting API

This API is used to indicate that payment is received for given details.

3 cases are to be handled :

1. Successful posting
2. Failure
3. Duplicate Payment

##### Request

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "loan_number": "123456789",
    "amountPaid": "1290.20",
    "transactionId": "AX09812J812", // BBPS Transaction Reference ID
    "paymentMode": "UPI", // optional
    "paymentDate" : "2021-07-17" // optional,
    "billNumber" : "TUVW1234"
    // any other information required for successful posting
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

**Note: Any other details that are required in this API need to be present as part of the Fetch API.**

##### Successful Posting

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "acknowledgementId": "1AJI1344"
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

##### Failure

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "status": "FAILURE",
    "acknowledgementId": ""
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

##### Duplicate Payment

When payment had been posted successfully but we got a `Failure` response for some reason from the API and retry this payment again.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "status": "DUPLICATE",
    "acknowledgementId": ""
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

Difference between `Failure` and `Duplicate` is maintained since in case of `Failure` Axis or even Setu will retry payment in batches until it is accepted. Whereas in case of `Duplicate` there are no retries.

Duplicacy check can be added on the basis of the `BBPS Transaction Reference ID`.
