#### How it works

Here is a typical list of steps involved in collecting payments from a customer. Let’s use the example of a borrower repaying a loan amount from a lender. In this scenario, the lender is the Biller partner that has integrated with Setu.

1. Customer opens a UPI or banking app of their choice, and clicks on “Loans”.
2. A list of lenders is displayed, from where the customer selects their lender.
3. The customer then verifies themselves by entering their loan number / mobile number, which the lender recognises and can use as a customer identifier. Refer: <a href="api-reference#/category~APIs_to_Implement/operation~fetchCustomerBills" target="_blank"><code>fetchCustomerBills</code>↗</a>
4. The customer views the amount to be repaid, and pays. Note that the UI shows an exact amount to be paid, but we also support partial amounts with custom validation.
5. The app asks for the payment method, and the customer selects, say, UPI.
6. Customer enters UPI mPIN to pay from preferred bank account.
7. Payment is completed, verified as per biller validations and settled to biller account on T+2.
