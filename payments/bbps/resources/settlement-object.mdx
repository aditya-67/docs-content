## Settlement object

The Setu bill object can optionally contain instructions on how to settle a collected bill amount, as part of the `settlement` object shown in the sample code snippet.

The `settlement` object contains the following details—

1. Which bank account(s) the settlement should be deposited to.
2. What is the split applied on the amount when making the settlement.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`"data" : {
    "customer": {
        "name": "Shailesh"
    },
    "billDetails" : {
        "billFetchStatus" : "AVAILABLE",
        "bills" : [
            {
                "generatedOn"       : "2020-06-04T06:59:04Z" // bill generation / fee start date, 
                "dueDate"           : "2020-06-04T06:59:04Z" // last date for fee payment,  
                "recurrence"        : "ONE_TIME",  
                "amountExactness"   : "EXACT", 
                "billerBillID"      : "string",  // bill identifier, sent with each payment
                "customerAccount"   : {},
                "amount"            : {}, //amount against the bill
                "items"             : [], // array of line items
                "aggregates"        : {}, // details on final amount that the customer needs to pay
                "settlement"        : {
                    // details about the settlement instructions for this bill
                     "primaryAccount" : {},
                     "parts" : []
                } 
            }
        ]
    }
}`}

### When to use the settlement object

The common use cases for utilising the settlement object have been elaborated below.

<Callout type="highlight">
  This is an optional parameter. If the <code>settlement</code> object is not
  present in bill object, we will settle the full amount to the{" "}
  <strong>primary</strong> bank account set as part of the merchant
  configuration on The Bridge.
</Callout>

<hr class="secondary" />

##### Case 1 — Redirect entire funds to a different account

A primary account is where the entire funds are settled to by default, in the absence of any settlement instructions. Exactly 1 account can be marked as primary on The Bridge.

In the event you would like to redirect the funds away from this account, you can specify the preferred settlement account as the `primaryAccount` inside the settlement object. This specifies the settlement account to be changed only for this bill, other settlements will continue to happen to your primary account.

<Callout type="warning">
  The account you specify as primary in the <code>settlement</code> object has
  to be one of the accounts already marked as <code>CERTIFIED</code> on The
  Bridge. Otherwise, the settlement would fail.
</Callout>

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Case 2 — Split funds into different accounts

Some business use cases require a bill to be split and settled to multiple bank accounts. Some examples could be—

1. Different collection accounts for different heads
2. Different line items belong to different parts of the organization (departments, sub organizations, business entities, etc)
3. Splits to vendor/partner accounts

<Callout type="highlight">We support upto 5 splits on a single bill.</Callout>
<br />

Setu supports this using the `settlement` object in the merchant’s fetch API, so that the merchant can pass on their bill settlement preference to us, and Setu can take care of settlement scenarios.

<Callout type="warning">
  Splits work only if <code>amountExactness</code> is set to <code>EXACT</code>{" "}
  or <code>EXACT_UP</code> , ie, the customer can pay the exact bill amount or
  more. In case paid amount is more than bill amount, the extra money will be
  settled to the primary account specified in the <code>settlement</code>{" "}
  object.
</Callout>

<hr class="primary" />

### Settlement object structure

The `settlement` JSON object consists of 2 objects—

- `parts`—contains the split rules for settlement
- `primaryAccount`—money is transferred to this account after all splits have been settled

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "settlement" : {
        "parts"          : [],
        "primaryAccount" : {},
    },
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<hr class="secondary" />

##### Parts

Parts is an array of objects that defines the split and account to which that split should be settled.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`"parts" : [
    {
        "account" : {
            "id"   : "string",
            "ifsc" : "string",
            "name" : "string"   //optional
        },
        "split" : {
            "unit" : "INR",
            "value": int, // in paise
        }
        "remarks"   : "string"   //optional
    }
]`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

**Descriptions**

- `account.id` Bank account number for the settlement of this particular split
- `account.ifsc` Bank IFSC for the settlement of desired split part
- `account.name` Name that appears against the bank account account
- `split.unit` Unit by which the split part is calculated. The supported value is `INR` or Indian National Rupee.
- `split.value` Value of the split relative to the mentioned unit, `INR` accepts `integer` values and treats them as amount in paise. **Please note** that we expect only values converted to paise, for simplicity of calculations.
- `remarks` Description of the split that will appear in the settlement report.

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Primary account

Primary account is an account object which defines the bank account where the balance amount is settled after calculating and settling all the splits. Here is what it looks like.

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`"primaryAccount" : {
        "id"   : "string",
        "ifsc" : "string",
        "name" : "string"   //optional
    }
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<br />

<Callout type="warning">
  Only one bank account can be specified here, otherwise the settlement will be
  rejected.
</Callout>

<br />

**Descriptions**

- `account.id` Bank account number for the primary account
- `account.ifsc` Bank IFSC for the primary account
- `account.name` Name against primary account. This is optional.

<hr class="primary" />

### Split calculation method

Setu always start calculating the splits by secondary accounts, that is, accounts that are _not_ marked as `primaryAccount` in the settlement object. Based on the following descriptions, you can set your business logic to allow for proper splits that are accepted by Setu.

<hr class="secondary" />

##### Split by fixed amount value(s)

Enter the exact amount of the split(s) in paise. The total of split parts should either add up to the total bill settlement amount or be less than that.

In case of the latter, we will calculate the difference between the two and settle the difference to the account marked as `primaryAccount` in the settlement object.

<Callout type="warning">
  Settlement will be rejected in case the total of splits exceeds the bill
  settlement amount.
</Callout>

<br />

**Example scenario**— For a bill of ₹100, a merchant wants ₹20 for itself and the remaining balance has to be settled to a vendor bank account. For this scenario, the `settlement` object would look like—

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "primaryAccount" : {
        "account"   : {
            "id"   : "vendor-bank-account-number",
            "ifsc" : "vendor-bank-ac-ifsc"
        }
      },
      "parts" : [
            {
                "account" : {
                    "id"   : "biller-bank-ac-number",
                    "ifsc" : "biller-bank-ac-ifsc"
                },
                "split" : {
                    "unit"  : "INR",
                    "value" : 2000 // in paise
                }
           }
       ]
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

<hr class="tertiary" />

##### Split settlement example

Take the following scenario—

**Amount to settle**: 200000 (₹2000), which is the amount actually paid by customer, in _paise_

<CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
  {`{
    "primaryAccount" : {
        "account" : {
            "id"   : "TUITION-FEE-ACCOUNT",
            "ifsc" : "string"
        }
    },
    "parts" : [
        {
            "account" : {
                "id"   : "BUS_FEE_ACCOUNT",
                "ifsc" : "string"
            },
            "split" : {
                "value" : 60000,
                "unit"  : "INR"
            },
            "remarks" : "Sports fee"
        },
        {
            "account" : {
                "id"   : "SPORTS-FEE-ACCOUNT",
                "ifsc" : "string"
            },
            "split" : {
                "value": 40000,
                "unit" : "INR"
            },
            "remarks" : "Sports fee"
        }
    ]
}`}
</CodeBlockWithCopy>

The resulting settlement happens as follows, with the values in _paise_—

1. ₹600 for the bus fee account: 60000
2. ₹400 for the sports fee account: 40000
3. Balance of ₹1000 for the tuition fee account: 100000
