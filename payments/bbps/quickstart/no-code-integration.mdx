## No-code CSV integration

Setu BBPS BillCollect allows billers to get on-boarded on BBPS without implementing any APIs on their end. You can upload your customers’ bills via a predefined CSV format.

<Callout type="highlight">
  If you wish to integrate with APIs instead of CSV, please follow this guide
  for{" "}

## How to integrate

Start by signing up on <a href="https://bridge.setu.co/" target="_blank">The Bridge ↗</a>, if you haven’t already. This is Setu’s single portal for managing all your integrations with us.

<Callout type="tip">
  If you have an existing biller configuration, skip to Step 3.
</Callout>

<br />

### Step 1 — Create a biller on The Bridge

Head to the **Available products** page via the sidebar and click on one of the Collect BBPS cards under the **Payments** tab. Click on **Create a Biller** button. Make sure you select the **CSV upload** option while creating your biller.

/>

<hr class="primary" />

### Step 2 — Add configuration on The Bridge

After the biller creation step, we should be on the biller profile. Here, you will see four tabs—**Dashboard**, which is an overview page, **Configuration** has all the integration details for this biller, **Transactions** where you can see test payments made to this biller, and **Copy to Production**, to copy the same config to Production later.

Click the **Configuration** tab from the biller profile. Add biller details and the bill details before proceeding to the integration setup. The customer identifiers you enter will determine the CSV format.

- **Attribute name** is the _variable or parameter_ name that your system recognises as the identifier to uniquely identify a customer. Make sure this name matches with the column name, which has the customer identifier data in your CSV.

- **Attribute displayed as** is what the user would see in the payment app such as PhonePe or GPay.

- **Length** denotes the minimum and maximum number of characters the customer can enter for the identifier.

- **Regex / pattern** helps to check if the identifier entered by the customer is valid or not.

You can define up to 4 customer idenitifers.

<Callout type="tip">
  You can test customer identifiers that you configure, on Bridge. A sample app
  is available at the bottom-right of the screen on your configuration page, to
  test the integration.
</Callout>

<hr class="primary" />

#### Step 3 — Prepare CSV file for bills

Now scroll down to the integration setup section. Here, you should see a sample CSV generated based on the customer identifiers you entered in the **Bill details** section. You may also edit the column names, should you wish to do so.

  alt="CSV file"

Once you’ve finalised the column names of the CSV, download a sample and add in all your customer bills to the file.

<Callout type="warning">
  Verify that the column names in your CSV file the latest sample format on the
  UI to avoid any errors.
</Callout>

<hr class="primary" />

#### Step 4 — Upload bills in CSV file

Head to the **Dashboard** tab. In the Upload CSV section, drag and drop the CSV file that has your customer bills.

Upload progress will be shown on the right side panel. On the panel, you will also see a log of all the previously uploaded CSV files, the latest will be top-most.

<Callout type="warning">
  Large CSV files may take some time to get parsed and be shown on the UI.
</Callout>

<br />

Once the CSV upload is successful, you should be able to see the number of bills uploaded and saved in the system.

  alt="Upload CSV"

<hr class="tertiary" />

#### Upload another CSV file with bills

You can add new bills to the system in the same way as described above. When you upload a CSV file, bills with new customer identifiers will be appended to existing bill data.

<Callout type="warning">
  Bills with the same customer identifiers as previously uploaded bills will get
  overwritten with the latest bill amount. If bill amount is “0”, it will be
  considered to be a paid bill and no outstanding dues will be shown to your
  customer.

<Callout type="highlight">
  When your customers make payments against bills, transaction and payment
  status is made available to you in the{" "}

  section.
