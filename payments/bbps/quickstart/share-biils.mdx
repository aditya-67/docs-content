## How to share bills with Setu

When a customer enters their identifier on a payment app, NPCI requires Setu to respond with bill details from a biller's system. For this, the biller needs to define a way to share bills with Setu.

After configuring the expected bill format on The Bridge, the biller can use 2 different ways to do so—either via CSV upload or via API integration.

### Share bills using CSV upload

After all bill details are configured, an expected CSV file format will be generated by Setu and shared on The Bridge. Use this sample format to upload bill details.

The CSV would always include customer identifier(s) and at times, other parameters that you may have added in the “Additional information for customer” or “Bill breakup details” sections.

Additionally you would need to add the bill amount, bill due date and other details as per the CSV format.

### Share bills using API integration

Implement a `baseURL` path that can be called by Setu to fetch bills, using your preferred authentication protocol.

<Callout type="warning">
  Setu will add `/fetch/bills` or `/bills/fetchReceipt` at the end of this URL.
</Callout>

<br />

You will need to ensure that the bill response structure matches the bill configuration you have provided on The Bridge. For example, any additional info string that has been defined should exactly match the value returned in the bill response.

### Comparison between CSV upload & API integration

Both ways of sharing bills have their own advantages and pitfalls. To help you decide which solution works best for you, here's a quick comparison between the two methods—

  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>CSV upload</th>
    <th>API integration</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Time to integrate</td>
    <td>~1 hour.</td>
    <td>~2-3 days.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bill validation</td>
    <td>
      Every uploaded CSV file is validated and Admin is notified over e-mail
      about any invalid bill identifiers.
    </td>
    <td>
      Sample identifiers are validated only to test integration. After going
      live, bills are fetched real time, and identifiers are validated by NPCI
      directly.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bill details</td>
    <td>
      Uses details available from CSV, which doesn't reflect the latest info as
      per biller system.
    </td>
    <td>
      Latest bill details are fetched from biller system by calling the fetch
      bill API with the <code>baseURL</code>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Notifications</td>
    <td>Not available.</td>
    <td>
      Can be optionally configured to notify the biller system for successful
      payments and settlements.

  </tr>
